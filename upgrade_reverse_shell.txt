1. First, get a dumb reverse shell running in a nc session.

2. Upgrade to PTY with python

Run this in the remote shell
$ python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

You now have a pseudotty running, which means you can use commands such as su and ssh.

3. Upgrade to full TTY using wizardry

Send the nc session to the background with ctrl+z

$ echo $TERM
Take note (note #1)

$ stty -a
Take note of rows (note #2) and columns (note #3)

Now, disable echoing and enable raw in/out
$ stty raw -echo

Since echoing is now disabled, you will not see the next command

Get back into the nc session
$ fg 
$ reset

Set variables
$ export SHELL=bash
$ export TERM=(note #1)
$ stty rows (note #2) columns (note #3)

bash: to exit the reverse shell, exit all the way with ctrl+d, and then
$ stty -raw echo

sh: To exit the reverse shell, either kill the pane...
ctrl+b x y
...or respawn it
ctrl+b :respawn-pane -k
